# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We're building ML models to predict food allergies—serious work that deserves a serious, respectful environment. We're committed to making this project welcoming to everyone, regardless of experience level, background, identity, or perspective.

## Standards

### We Encourage

- **Collaborative spirit**: Share knowledge, help each other debug, and celebrate wins together
- **Constructive feedback**: Code reviews should improve the work, not tear down the person
- **Scientific rigor**: Challenge ideas with data and logic, not dogma
- **Clear communication**: Explain your reasoning, document your code, ask questions when stuck
- **Diverse perspectives**: Different backgrounds bring different insights—especially valuable in health ML
- **Learning mindset**: Nobody knows everything. Mistakes happen. We learn and move forward.

### Zero Tolerance For

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Trolling, inflammatory comments, or deliberate disruption
- Sexual or inappropriate content
- Anything that would make someone feel unsafe or unwelcome

## Scope

This applies everywhere in our project space:

- GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, and code reviews
- Discord server communication
- Project-related emails and DMs
- Any other project-affiliated interactions

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **Discord**: Contact a moderator or admin on the [huggingscience Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/VYkdEVjJ5J) tagging @AI for Allergies Team Leader.
2. **GitHub**: Report via the repository's "Report" feature or contact maintainers directly

All reports are handled confidentially. You won't be required to confront anyone directly.

### What Happens Next

- We'll investigate fairly and promptly
- We'll protect your privacy throughout the process
- We'll determine appropriate action based on severity

### Possible Actions

Depending on the violation:

- Warning and request for apology
- Temporary suspension from project spaces
- Permanent ban from all project communication channels
- Reporting to relevant institutions or authorities (for serious violations)

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers will:

- Model the behavior we expect from contributors
- Address violations promptly and fairly
- Clearly communicate decisions when appropriate
- Protect reporters from retaliation
- Update this Code of Conduct as needed

## Context Matters

We're working on health ML, which means:

- **Respect patient privacy**: Never share real patient data or identifying information
- **Scientific disagreement is healthy**: Debate methods and results vigorously but respectfully
- **Healthcare sensitivity**: Be mindful when discussing allergies and health conditions
- **Ethical considerations**: We're building tools that could affect real lives—take that seriously

## Questions?

Not sure if something violates the Code of Conduct? Ask. It's better to check than to guess.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html) and tailored for scientific ML collaboration.

**Bottom line**: Be professional, be kind, and focus on the science. If you can't do that, this isn't the project for you.
